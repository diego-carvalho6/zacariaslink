I started my career working as an employee in a small glass company, organized both stock and sales until finally I entered a college and fell in love with the technology and programming area

I'm an IT student with a passion for programming who has always wanted to work in the production of games with my own ideas, as well as developing IAs.

I have skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Code version control with GIT and agile SCRUM
